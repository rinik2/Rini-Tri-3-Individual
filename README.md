# TT0 Data Structures Key Learnings
- Linear list ex: for loops, enhanced for-loops
- Non-linear list accessed by keys
- Procedural is a type of imperative programming. Use flowchart diagrams bc they're more focused on procedure.
- OOP knows some of your key properties and then solves your problem
- Arrays: store primitive types, each index is an element (non-linear Hashmaps) + holds values in key-value pairs (the values of the keys could even be array) (linear, direct access thru key)
- Standardize: means to simplify how things are executed so theres not 1M ways to execute something


# TT1 Linked Lists Key Learnings
Generic T:

is iterable
nil = null (means the same thing, have reached endpoint, both mean 'nothing')

Stack: last in, first out Queue: first in, last out

remove packages & related use of packages from main (in #3) to get it to run

implements, similar to extend, but you just get the elements of the other class, gives you methods that you need to define (similar to abstract)

elements between head & tail are connected thru the linked list

Previous node: connecting to the node behind you Next node: connecting to the node in front of you If there is no node in front/behind you, then the previous/next value is "null"
